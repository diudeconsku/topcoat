## 2. Explore the user interface and basic tools
 
The next step to learn Revit MEP is to familiarize yourself with the user interface and basic tools of the software. The user interface of Revit MEP consists of several elements, such as the ribbon, the quick access toolbar, the project browser, the properties palette, the view control bar, the status bar, and the drawing area. You can customize the user interface according to your preferences and workflow.
 
The basic tools of Revit MEP allow you to create and modify elements in your model, such as walls, floors, ceilings, roofs, doors, windows, stairs, railings, furniture, fixtures, equipment, ducts, pipes, cables, lighting devices, panels, switches, outlets, fire alarms, sprinklers, etc. You can access these tools from the ribbon or use keyboard shortcuts for faster operation. You can also use filters, visibility settings, worksets, phases, levels, grids, reference planes, dimensions, annotations, tags, text, symbols, schedules, legends, and views to organize and manage your model.
